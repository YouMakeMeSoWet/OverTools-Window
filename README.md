# OverTools Window
This Python script provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for extracting Overwatch game assets
using OverTools. OverTools is a utility for extracting various game assets from Blizzard
Entertainment's Overwatch.

# Notes:
- Ensure that the Overwatch game folder is correctly specified to enable successful extraction.
- The extracted assets will be saved to the specified output folder.
